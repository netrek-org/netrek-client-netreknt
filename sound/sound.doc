This directory contains all the necessary files to add sound to COW.

This tar file consists of this DOC file, a soundplayer and a sounds
dir containing the sounds used. All precompiled COW clients have
already sound support included.
 
So just move or copy the sounds directory to an appropriate place,
and then add a line to your .xtrekrc to tell netrek where to find the
sounds like this:
sounddir:	/usr/local/netrek/sounds
#sound:		on/off 		Initialy turns sound on or off.
#soundplayer:	bgsndplay	Name of the background sound player.

It can go anywhere in the .xtrekrc. If you don't have or use an xtrekrc,
then use an environment variable called SOUNDDIR to tell netrek where it
is, otherwise it tries to find the sounds in the ./sounds dir. 

Additionally you have to put the "bgsndplay" program anywhere to a directory
included in your path.

Also, if you have any better sounds for the sounds it makes, simply change
the links in the sound directory to new sounds. 

NOTE for SGI users:
 The SGI bgsndplay program requires aiff files instead of the sun .au files.
 You may convert the included sounds with the command:
	
	sfconvert infile.au outfile.aiff format aiff int 8 2 chan 1
or for the raw files:
	sfconvert infile.au outfile.aiff -i channels 1 rate 8000 mulaw end format aiff int 8 2

Once the game is running, use the ~ key (which can be remapped of course),
to bring up the sound menu. This enables you to turn individual sounds 
on/off, and to turn ALL sounds on/off. 

For informations on non sound related features we refer to the documentation
of the COW client.

Special thanks to Neil Cook for the initial sources of his sound client.

Happy Dooshing!
