Redo the player list.
At the very least, place seperator between teams.
Could possibly divide it into two columns, one for each team.
Somehow need a full player list on a 1024x768 screen
Would also be nice to be able to do 'I' type information from it

----

Metaserver.
Create fallback metaserver lists.
Perhaps method to utilize HTTP requests for server names.

----

Bitmaps
Compile bitmaps into resource DLL's.  (done)
This should allow a way to easily utilize 256 color bitmaps

Should also look into color palettes.  One of the problems is having
multiple copies of Netrek open using color bitmaps.

Ok, now the suggestion is to take the bitmaps out of resource DLLs, instead
loading the bmp from a file, thus allowing even easier configuration.

----

DirectX
Look into conversion of display routines.  This should help eliminate
flicker and such.

----

Documentation
- Coding standards
- Document program interfaces, such as network interfaces
- Document method for creating resource DLLs

----

Code
- Format code using standard naming conventions
- Clean up code which is no longer utilized, experimental etc.
- Create methodology for debug code
- Prototype the source code, put function definitions in header file
- Clean up defaults code, check for non-existing features and/or
  redundancy.
  
----

Client Configuration
- Need better documentation
- Need a program to configure client settings
- Work on default windows arrangement for 1024x768 display

----

Redirect message types
- Basic idea is to identify the different types of messages and then
establish a mapping as to which windows they should appear in

----

Sounds
- Work on sound configuration.  Put Wav files into resource DLL?  Allowing
for easy customization.

----

Features
- Remove the stupid ctrl-b bombing message, and ignore bombing messages coming from other clients.
